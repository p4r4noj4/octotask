## Indentation
* Project is developed under JetBrains IDEs
* Make sure you are using [JetBrains Codestyle](https://github.com/vucalur/JetBrains-Codestyle) to indent your code.
* Some files, file parts should not be formatted - check what youâ€™re committing.
* **Warning:** The formatter tends to leave parts of CoffeeScript code unindented or screw CS indentation at all. Beware.
